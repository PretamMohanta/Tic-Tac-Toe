A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with an intuitive user interface. The game allows two players to compete by taking turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. It includes logic to determine the winner or identify a draw, and provides a clear visual indication of the game's outcome. The project demonstrates fundamental game development principles, including user input handling, game state management, and interface design.
